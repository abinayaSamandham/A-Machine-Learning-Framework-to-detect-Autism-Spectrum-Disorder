# A-Machine-Learning-Framework-to-detect-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may be detected using the XGBoost Machine learning approach. The  feature extraction, and model training using a broad range of medical imaging datasets, including MRI and CT scans is done . The XGBoost model is optimized for performance via the application of cross-validation techniques
